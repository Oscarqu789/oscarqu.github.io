Hello!! <br>
I am Oscar qu. This is my website about our GP project.<br>
Wellcom.
Our Project is based on the lack of food during the Quarantine time.And the impact of it on people's daily life and economy <br>
And we want to grow awareness about this thing and also to let more people know about it . <br>
 Here we have 4 examples, and each of them were known in the world.<br>
The UK ranks 20th in the world in pork production, is a net importer of pork and has highly concentrated slaughter capacity, but in 2021, they had to burn the pigs because of butchers are not enough.<br> In 2021, Covid-19 wreaks havoc in England, due to covid-19 and the policy changing because of Brexit, there are 15-20% butchers in UK back to their own country, which causes the decreased of the ability to butcher the pig and the supply of pork to publics.<br> 
	This sound ridiculous to us that the pigs are not able to be butchered because there are not enough buthcers.<br> But in England, this had happened. And there is another question.<br>

<br>Here is some data from <pclass="aa">‘https://news.zhuwang.cc/guojixinwen/20211220/493224.html’<br>


<br>The UK ranks 20th in the world in pork production, is a net importer of pork and has highly concentrated slaughter capacity.<br>
At the end of 2020, there were 4.758 million pigs in storage and 406,000 sows in storage, both up 0.3% year-on-year. <br>
UK farms generally showed a decline, from 13,600 in 1996 to 10,539 in 2019, a decrease of 22.5%, with an average of about 70 sows per household.<br>
The number of pig slaughterhouses decreased by 49.7% from 185 in 2000 to 93 in 2020, and the average annual slaughter volume increased by 82.8% from 5300 head to 96,900 head. <br>
There are 63, 11, 8, 3 and 8 slaughterhouses with annual slaughtering capacity within 10,000 head, 10001-30,000 head, 301-100,000 head, 100001-500,000 head and 500,000 head, respectively.<br> 
The slaughtering capacity accounts for 2%, 2%, 4%, 9% and 83%, respectively. 
Similar to countries such as Germany and the US, pig slaughtering capacity in the UK has been affected by COVID-19 and other factors since 2020. <br>
In 2020, 11.2 million pigs were slaughtered and 984,300 tons of pork was produced, including 497,000 imported live pigs. <br>
In 2020, the UK imported 891,600 tons of pork products (including 388,300 tons of fresh frozen pork) and exported 3202,000 tons (including 259,600 tons of fresh frozen pork).<br>
All the imported pork was from the EU, and 65% of the pork was exported to countries outside the EU. <br>
The annual consumption of pork was about 1.58 million tons, and the self-sufficiency rate was 62.5 percent in 2020, 8.6 percentage points and 4.4 percentage points higher than in 2018 and 2019, respectively.<br>
January to October 2021 pork output 857,600 tons, a year-on-year increase of 5.3%, January to September fresh frozen pork exports 145,100 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 24.5%, import 229,100 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 13.3%.<br>
