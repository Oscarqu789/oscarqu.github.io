<p dir="ltr">Our GP research project is how Covid-19 impacted people’s daily 
life and economy. Here we have 4 examples, and each of them were known in the 
world.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The UK ranks 20th in the world in pork production, is a net importer of pork and 
has highly concentrated slaughter capacity, but in 2021, they had to burn the 
pigs because of butchers are not enough. <br />
In 2021, Covid-19 wreaks havoc in England, due to covid-19 and the policy 
changing because of Brexit, there are 15-20% butchers in UK back to their own 
country, which causes the decreased of the ability to butcher the pig and the 
supply of pork to publics.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This sound ridiculous to us that the pigs are not able to be butchered because 
there are not enough buthcers. But in England, this had happened. And there is 
another question.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here is some data from</p>

<p>The UK ranks 20th in the world in pork production, is a net importer of pork 
and has highly concentrated slaughter capacity. At the end of 2020, there were 
4.758 million pigs in storage and 406,000 sows in storage, both up 0.3% 
year-on-year.<br />
&nbsp;UK farms generally showed a decline, from 13,600 in 1996 to 10,539 in 
2019, a decrease of 22.5%, with an average of about 70 sows per household.<br />
&nbsp;The number of pig slaughterhouses decreased by 49.7% from 185 in 2000 to 
93 in 2020, and the average annual slaughter volume increased by 82.8% from 5300 
head to 96,900 head. <br />
There are 63, 11, 8, 3 and 8 slaughterhouses with annual slaughtering capacity 
within 10,000 head, 10001-30,000 head, 301-100,000 head, 100001-500,000 head and 
500,000 head, respectively. The slaughtering capacity accounts for 2%, 2%, 4%, 
9% and 83%, respectively. <br />
Similar to countries such as Germany and the US, pig slaughtering capacity in 
the UK has been affected by COVID-19 and other factors since 2020. In 2020, 11.2 
million pigs were slaughtered and 984,300 tons of pork was produced, including 
497,000 imported live pigs.<br />
&nbsp;In 2020, the UK imported 891,600 tons of pork products .<br />
And there is a&nbsp; photo for example.</p>

<p>And Shanghai also faced some really big difficulties during the Corantine 
time.<br />
&nbsp;Restaurant closures and working from home resulted in a large increase in 
eating at-home, reaching 88% of all eating and drinking occasions in spring 
2020—up 12% from 2019—while away-from-home occasions have been cut in half.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen X witnessed the largest decrease in the amount of at-work occasions, going 
from 10% of all eating in spring 2019 to 4% in spring 2020.</p>
<p>However, more time spent cooking at home is tiring people out as 70% spent 
more time cooking and 33% much more time cooking, according to DoorDash’s Deep 
Dish report. Only 7% spent less time cooking. <br />
Twenty-five percent order more food when they order takeout so they have 
leftovers and 47% agree they are “tired of cooking for myself after three months 
of COVID-19 restrictions.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Eating driven by boredom also increased, going from 4% of all occasions in 2019 
to 7% in 2020. Consumption of ready-to-eat foods and beverages is the highest 
among afternoon and evening snacks when boredom plays a stronger role.</p>
