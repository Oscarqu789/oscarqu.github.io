	Our GP research project is how Covid-19 impacted people’s daily life and economy. In our project, we have 4 
	examples an we analysis each of them and find out the reason caused this, how can we prevent the same thing 
	happened again and how would the publics deal with the problems. 
	We also have perspectives of how the foreigner view on this question and different classes view on the issue. 
	The UK ranks 20th in the world in pork production, is a net importer of pork and has highly concentrated 
	slaughter capacity, but in 2021, they had to burn the pigs because of butchers are not enough. In 2021, Covid-19 
	wreaks havoc in England, due to covid-19 and the policy changing because of Brexit, there are 15-20% butchers in 
	UK back to their own country, which causes the decreased of the ability to butcher the pig and the supply of 
	pork to publics. 
	This sound ridiculous to us that the pigs are not able to be butchered because there are not enough butcher. But 
	in England, this had happened. 
	Inside England, many experts thinks that the pigs need to be burnt because UK Brexit, and the UK government then 
	make a list of those careers need to be introduced. But which makes the butchers depressed in UK is that 
	the dancer is in the list of the careers need to be introduced instead of butchers. They couldn’t understand why 
	because as we mentioned before, there are a 15-20% lack of butchers, and this has directly affected the gross 
	national happiness index because the pigs in the farms are too much and according to the law in England, the 
	pigs are not allowed to be slaughtered in the farm. I think that this law is a bit silly under the condition as 
	on one hand, there aren’t enough pigs in markets, and on the other hand, too many pigs were stacked in the farm, 
	waited to be burnt instead of be slaughtered just because of butcher is lacking.

	2，During the quarantine at 2022 Shanghai had faced a lot of difficulties and the lack of food is the most 
	important one. And I think that there are two mean reasons why people in SHanghai can't get food during the 
	Quarantine. 
	The first reason is that the local government is poorly prepared for this. They are poorly prepared for his 
	because governments are over confident and over their ability to contain the out break. 
	The second reason is that Shanghai shops that sell vegetables often get food from other city every day, so after 
	lock down, People can only buy food from online shops which is not enough. 
	A norman citicen will be affect a lot, but a farmer will not care because they all have food in there own farm. 
	As a result in a famous Shanghai Website，more then 300shops closed down during the quarantine time and the 
	reason why that happened is because the customers all get lock down so they can't go out to buy any thing and 
	also the waiters can't go to their work because they are also in quarantine。 
	&nbsp;During that time.

	3，Jawaharlal Nehru university center for economic research and planning research scholar who ShaLi, sal (the 
	Vaishali Bansal) on July 10, published an article on the "deccan herald the food shortages (food insecurity) and 
	hunger in India will continue to spread, from the perspective of its observation revealed India's real food 
	security situation for us. 
	
	Mr. Bansal cited the latest "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World" report, which five United 
	Nations agencies jointly released on July 6, It predicts that India will continue to face widespread and 
	worsening food shortages. 
	
	According to the data in the report, 560 million people, or about 40.6 percent of the population, suffered from 
	moderate or severe food shortages in 2019-21. 
	
	The proportion of people suffering from severe food shortages in India increased from 20.3% in 2018-2020 to 
	22.3% in 2019-2021, while the chronically hungry population increased from 14.6% in 2018-2020 to 16.3%.

	3，Restaurant closures and working from home resulted in a large increase in eating at-home, reaching 88% of all 
	eating and drinking occasions in spring 2020—up 12% from 2019—while away-from-home occasions have been cut in 
	half. 
	
	Gen X witnessed the largest decrease in the amount of at-work occasions, going from 10% of all eating in spring 
	2019 to 4% in spring 2020.However, more time spent cooking at home is tiring people out as 70% spent more time 
	cooking and 33% much more time cooking, according to DoorDash’s Deep Dish report. Only 7% spent less time 
	cooking. Twenty-five percent order more food when they order takeout so they have leftovers and 47% agree they 
	are “tired of cooking for myself after three months of COVID-19 restrictions.” 
	
	
	
	Eating driven by boredom also increased, going from 4% of all occasions in 2019 to 7% in 2020. Consumption of 
	ready-to-eat foods and beverages is the highest among afternoon and evening snacks when boredom plays a stronger 
	role.
