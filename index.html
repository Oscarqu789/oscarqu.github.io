UK ranks 20th in the world in pork production, is a net importer of pork and has 
highly concentrated slaughter capacity, but in 2021, they had to burn the pigs 
because of butchers are not enough. <br />
In 2021, Covid-19 wreaks havoc in England, due to covid-19 and the policy 
changing because of Brexit, there are 15-20% butchers in UK back to their own 
country, which causes the decreased of the ability to butcher the pig and the 
supply of pork to publics. <o:p></o:p></span><br />
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This sound ridiculous to us that the pigs are not able to be butchered 
because there are not enough butcher. But in England, this had happened. <o:p></o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Inside England, many experts thinks that the pigs need to be burnt 
because UK Brexit, and the UK government then make a list of those careers need 
to be introduced.<br />
&nbsp;But which makes the butchers depressed in UK is that<span lang="zh-cn">
</span>the dancer is in the list of the careers need to be introduced instead of 
butchers. <br />
They couldn’t understand why because as we mentioned before, there are a 15-20% 
lack of butchers, and this has directly affected the gross national happiness 
index because the pigs in the farms are too much and according to the law in 
England, the pigs are not allowed to be slaughtered in the farm. <br />
I think that this law is a bit silly under the condition as on one hand, there 
aren’t enough pigs in markets, and on the other hand, too many pigs were stacked 
in the farm, waited to be burnt instead of be slaughtered just because of 
butcher is lacking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">The UK ranks 20th in the world in pork 
production, is a net importer of pork and has highly concentrated slaughter 
capacity. At the end of 2020, there were 4.758 million pigs in storage and 
406,000 sows in storage, both up 0.3% year-on-year. <br />
UK farms generally showed a decline, from 13,600 in 1996 to 10,539 in 2019, a 
decrease of 22.5%, with an average of about 70 sows per household. The number of 
pig slaughterhouses decreased by 49.7% from 185 in 2000 to 93 in 2020, and the 
average annual slaughter volume increased by 82.8% from 5300 head to 96,900 
head. <br />
There are 63, 11, 8, 3 and 8 slaughterhouses with annual slaughtering capacity 
within 10,000 head, 10001-30,000 head, 301-100,000 head, 100001-500,000 head and 
500,000 head, respectively. The slaughtering capacity accounts for 2%, 2%, 4%, 
9% and 83%, respectively. Similar to countries such as Germany and the US, pig 
slaughtering capacity in the UK has been affected by COVID-19 and other factors 
since 2020. In 2020, 11.2 million pigs were slaughtered and 984,300 tons of pork 
was produced, including 497,000 imported live pigs. In 2020, the UK imported 
891,600 tons of pork products (including 388,300 tons of fresh frozen pork) and 
exported 3202,000 tons (including 259,600 tons of fresh frozen pork).<br />
&nbsp;All the imported pork was from the EU, and 65% of the pork was exported to 
countries outside the EU. The annual consumption of pork was about 1.58 million 
tons, and the self-sufficiency rate was 62.5 percent in 2020, 8.6 percentage 
points and 4.4 percentage points higher than in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
<br />
January to October 2021 pork output 857,600 tons, a year-on-year increase of 
5.3%, January to September fresh frozen pork exports 145,100 tons, a 
year-on-year decrease of 24.5%, import 229,100 tons, a year-on-year decrease of 
13.3%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>And Shanghai also faced some really big difficulties during the Quaranantine time. People are all starving and locked in their home can't even walk around done stairs.  <br />
And I think that there are two mean reasons why people in SHanghai can't get food during the Quarantine.<br />
The first reason is that the local government is poorly prepared for this. They are poorly prepared for his because governments are over confident and over their ability to contain the out break.<b />
The second reason is that Shanghai shops that sell vegetables often get food from other city every day, so after lock down, People can only buy food from online shops which is not enough.<br />
A norman citicen will be affect a lot, but a farmer will not care because they all have food in there own farm.<br />
As a result in a famous Shanghai Website，more then 300shops closed down during the quarantine time and the reason why that happened is because the customers all get lock down so they can't go out to buy any thing and also the waiters can't go to their work because they are also in quarantine。
&nbsp;During that time. Restaurant closures and working from home resulted in a large increase in 
eating at-home, reaching 88% of all eating and drinking occasions in spring 
2020—up 12% from 2019—while away-from-home occasions have been cut in half.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gen X witnessed the largest decrease in the amount of at-work occasions, going 
from 10% of all eating in spring 2019 to 4% in spring 2020.</p>
<p>However, more time spent cooking at home is tiring people out as 70% spent 
more time cooking and 33% much more time cooking, according to DoorDash’s Deep 
Dish report. Only 7% spent less time cooking. <br />
Twenty-five percent order more food when they order takeout so they have 
leftovers and 47% agree they are “tired of cooking for myself after three months 
of COVID-19 restrictions.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Eating driven by boredom also increased, going from 4% of all occasions in 2019 
to 7% in 2020. Consumption of ready-to-eat foods and beverages is the highest 
among afternoon and evening snacks when boredom plays a stronger role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jawaharlal Nehru university center for economic research and planning 
research scholar who ShaLi, sal (the Vaishali Bansal) on July 10, published an 
article on the &quot;deccan herald the food shortages (food insecurity) and hunger in 
India will continue to spread, from the perspective of its observation revealed 
India&#39;s real food security situation for us.<br />
<br />
Mr. Bansal cited the latest &quot;State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World&quot; 
report, which five United Nations agencies jointly released on July 6, It 
predicts that India will continue to face widespread and worsening food 
shortages.<br />
<br />
According to the data in the report, 560 million people, or about 40.6 percent 
of the population, suffered from moderate or severe food shortages in 2019-21.<br />
<br />
The proportion of people suffering from severe food shortages in India increased 
from 20.3% in 2018-2020 to 22.3% in 2019-2021, while the chronically hungry 
population increased from 14.6% in 2018-2020 to 16.3%.</p>
